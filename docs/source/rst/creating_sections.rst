Creating Sections
=================

When creating your own arbitrary sections, pay attention to the following modeling rules:

* No floating segments;
* No floating points;
* No segments crossing each other;
* No coincident or partially overlapping segments;  
* Unique integer ids for materials, segments and points.

The best place to start creating your own sections is referring to the *Abdbeam* applications found in the :doc:`examples` page.
